# Pokedex-SwiftUI

Sample application using SwiftUI.

This is the same with the [Pokedex App](https://github.com/rynssnjn/Pokedex) I previously did, but the difference is that this is implemented using SwiftUI and not implemented into Coordinator Pattern.

Requests data from [PokeApi](https://pokeapi.co)

Splits code into different Views, View Models, Models, UIViewRepresantables.
